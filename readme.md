## About Laravel Api

Hello everyone, I've created a boilerplate for those who wish to use Laravel to expose API's. This project has been setup to handle test cases, seeders, observers, controller, custom commands etc.. I'll talk about it in more details below. 

## Instructions
Clone this project and run composer update to download all the packages used in this project.

## Custom Commands
I've created a few custom commands of my own to auto generate files which are needed to create a basic API.

To make life easier, I've created a command make:psapi which will create ALL the necessary files at once.
The above command will create the following files for you:

1. Model
2. Seeder
3. Observer
4. Feature Test
5. Controller
6. Resource
7. Request

Instruction on how to use the command:

> php artisan make:psapi -m {model_name} -a {api_name} -c {columns}

Example:
> php artisan make:psapi -m User -a users -c string.first_name:string.last_name:string.email
